# US Birth Data Dashboard
![Preview](images/a.png)

The project is inspired by an article called “Some people are too superstitious to have a baby on Friday the 13th written by “whoever”. It takes shape of a single web page that reflects US births data (for the years 2000 to 2014) in the form of dynamic data dashboard. The dashboard enables the users to manipulate the information and in turn visualise corresponding statistics. The main purpose of this interactive data panel is not only to prove or contradict the aforementioned article, but also to answer any possible data related questions, hence to satisfy user needs.
